# Levene and Brown-Forsynthe: Test for variances 
# Application to Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS)

Python algorithm to determine the optimal elevation threshold of a GNSS receiver. The model uses a statistical test known as the Brown-Forsynthe test. The receiver is a GPStation-6 model produced by Novatel Inc and is currently located at the Space Physics Laboratory at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University (Daytona Beach, FL).
